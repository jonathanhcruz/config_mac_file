#  File config Mac

This project is to make me easier to reinstall all aplications when reseting the computer. 

that's only to execute ``config_mac.sh ``  and  


## What does the script do?

This file install 

- Create  ``.bashrc ``
- Create ``.zshrc``
- Create `` .bash_profile``
- Create ``Alias`` in the terminal with my personal config.
- Install ``hombrew`` and ``wget``
- Install the ``OhMyZSH``
- Install ``nvim``
- Install ``nvm``
- Install ``node V18.18.0``
- Install ``node V14.21.3``

## Config

### .zshrc

Modify the ``ZSH_THEME `` in ``.zshrc`` file 

``
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
``

This line config the terminal's theme and it's so important to config the terminal's font, showing the changes carried out. 


### init.vim

On the other hand, it's imoprtant to add the file ``init.vim`` in ``~/.confing/nvim/``
